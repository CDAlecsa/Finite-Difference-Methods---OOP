# Some finite difference schemes generated in Spyder, based upon OOP classes, like Vector and Mesh.

This a data repository concerning an OOP implementation in Python for backward Euler methods.

'main.py':
- The main file consists in the implementation of implicit backward Euler scheme, using fsolve from scipy.optimize package.

'Vector.py':
- A vectort-type class similar to an usual array from numpy package. This will be used in the Mesh class.

'Mesh.py':
- The finite difference mesh class, that contains parameters like : initial value, initial time, final time, grid and length of the vector representation.
